ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm June Mwai,
  
I'm a number-crunching wizard and financial analyst with a knack for turning data into strategic gold. When I'm not diving deep into spreadsheets, you can find me coding smart financial models or creating insightful dashboards that help tech companies make data-driven decisions. 

I'm passionate about leveraging technology to optimize financial performance and always eager to collaborate on innovative projects. Let's connect and transform numbers into actionable insights together!

âš¡ Fun fact: I speak fluent Excel, SQL, and Power BI!
